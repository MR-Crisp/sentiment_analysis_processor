# Sentiment Analysis Processor

Aim of this project is to try and use machine learning to do senitment analysis on different phrases. 


## Plan

# Phase 1 (Completed)

In this phase, we plan to create the basic logic for the model. We will train the model on a data set that contains twitter tweets, in the dataset, the senitment of each tweet will be included for the training. Then we will use a test dataset to see how accurate the model is. At this phase, we will not worry about double negation and sarcasm as well as advanced litirarry techniques, but just try to get a basic prototype

# Phase 2

In this phase we plan to build a speach to text module, by connecting a microphoe, and running speach recognition, then running it through the senitment analysis. I also intend on building the microphone from cratch using cuircuits and components if given enough time. For this section I want to use my arduino uno to act as an actuator to make it possible. In addtion to that In this section I will also Aim to add a front end to connect to the API, this will most likely be Done in react. 

# Phase 3

In this phase we will improve the basic model. trying to make it more accurate, now taking into account double negatives and sarcasm. We will also make it so that the speach to text analysis innotation, tone and other things to help feed the model information to make better judgements.
